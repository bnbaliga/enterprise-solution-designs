# Visual Diagrams of Enerprise Solution Architecture & Design

In my role as an Enterprise Architecture, I try to understand existing application structure and capture the "As Is" state in a Visual diagram, use that understanding to propose improvements or new designs. This repository has some of my work from the past couple of years. These diagrams are not copyright of the comapnies I worked for, they are generic architecture principals and show cases to my potential future employers of my skills.
